This folder contains everything for building and deploying proxy container, based on nginx
It is based on these resources:
* http://nginx.org/en/docs/beginners_guide.html#proxy
* http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_proxy_module.html
* https://www.baeldung.com/nginx-forward-proxy

By default, the container listens on port 8090.
